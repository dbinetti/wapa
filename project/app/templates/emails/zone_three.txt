{{first_name}},

I'm writing you this personal message asking that you vote for Angie
Redford today because your vote matters.

In 2013, the race for Zone Three was decided by just nine votes.
Nine!

I'm optimistic this year because the dynamics in this race favor
Angie, but we simply can't take it for granted: the stakes are too
high.  I know that voting can be difficult to fit into a busy day,
but just think about the disruption of your child being sent home
unexpectedly for weeks because of the Board's quarantine policy;
voting today will help ensure that never happens again.

You can find your polling place here:  

https://gis.adacounty.id.gov/apps/electionday/

Just enter your residence address at the top and you'll find a nearby
location where you can cast your vote for Angie Redford and help
ensure parental choice, public trust, and Kids First for years to
come.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reply to this
message or just call/text my cell at 208.713.4599.  I want to help.

Thanks again for all your do for our kids in West Ada!


Best, Dave
