This is a one-time message from the West Ada Parents Association to
notify you about a recent Zone change in the West Ada School District.

Last year, the Board of Trustees updated the boundaries of the West
Ada School District Zones, as required by Idaho State Law.  This
process is called "redistricting", and it's designed to balance out
any population changes since the last Census.

As a result, your Board Trustee representative changed as of January.
Previously, you were in {{account.zone.name}}.  Now, you are currently in
{{new.name}}, and are represented by Trustee {{new.trustee_name}}.

The updated Districts can be found here:
https://westadaschools.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b35822da05084a77a2e3db09fcc51b13

If you have any questions about this change -- or believe this information
is inaccurate -- please let me know.  Otherwise, please keep your
new Trustee in mind when communicating with the Board.

Best, Dave
