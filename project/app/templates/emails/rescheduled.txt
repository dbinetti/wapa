TL;DR The Monday Zoom call is cancelled; a new call is planned for Sunday at 8:00PM.  

You'll need to re-register here:

Most of you likely received this as part of my WAPA update, but we've planned
a Rally for Monday at 6:00 PM at the district office, which means we can no
longer hold the Zoom call as planned.   This means that I needed to cancel
the Monday meeting and set up a new call for Sunday.

Apologies for the late notice, but I'm afraid there was no way to adequately
manage two events on the same day.

Thank you again for your interest, and I hope to see you on the call Sunday.

Best, Dave
