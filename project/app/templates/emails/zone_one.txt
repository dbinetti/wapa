I'm writing you this personal message asking that you vote for Lori
Frasure today because your vote matters.

In 2013, the race for Zone One was decided by just four votes.  Four!

I'm optimistic this year because the dynamics in this race favor Lori,
but we simply can't take it for granted: the stakes are too high.  I
know that voting can be difficult to fit into a busy day, but just
think about the disruption of your child being sent home unexpectedly
for weeks because of the Board's quarantine policy; voting today will
help ensure that never happens again.

You can find your polling place here:

https://gis.adacounty.id.gov/apps/electionday/

Just enter your residence address at the top and you'll find a nearby
location where you can cast your vote for Lori Frasure and help
ensure parental choice, public trust, and Kids First for years to
come.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reply to this
message or just call/text my cell at 208.713.4599.  I want to help.

Thanks again for all your do for our kids in West Ada!


Best, Dave
