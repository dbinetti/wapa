Message for: {{name}}

You are receiving this message because you signed up for our September 9
Zoom call discussing the Recall of Trustee Amy Johnson.

I'm writing because I currently show that you haven't yet joined the recall
effort.  Forgive me if this is in error, but assuming you're still interested
then I'd like you invite you to join us.

To participate, please click the following link:

https://www.recallamyjohnson.com/join

You'll be asked for your mobile number -- which is kept private and confidential --
and then can search for your voter record or learn how to register to vote to
participate in the official petition.

If you're not registered to vote, or are otherwise unable to support the recall
officially, then by joining you'll still see opportunities to volunteer to help
bring school back to normal.

If you have any questions please simply reply to this message.

Thank you again for putting kids first!

Best, Dave
