      <h3>School Operational Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Revisions to individual school building health and safety plans will be based upon an in-depth review of <strike>the school’s last 14 days positive cases in conjunction with a review of the data provided on the Leadership Dashboard</strike> <strong>morbidity and mortality rates for 1) students and 2) vaccinated staff</strong>.  The in-depth review is conducted by the Operational COVID 19 Response Team.  This team is a partnership between the West Ada Executive Team, school administrators, <strong>parent representatives, staff representatives</strong>, health services, CDH, <strike>and local health providers</strike>. The team determines, based on the <strike>7 data points used for decision making on the administration’s enhanced dashboard (see below), if an individual school needs to revise or add mitigating measures to the current Health and Safety Plan</strike>.  <strong>metrics indicated below, the appropriate response.</strong>Revisions or additions to mitigating measures may include but are not limited to use of masks, distancing/podding in the classroom, increased sanitizing protocols, changes in schedules to limit class size, or shifts to remote instruction <strong>as needed to protect student and staff safety.</strong>  <strike>for a limited time.  During this time, data will be routinely monitored by the Operational COVID 19 Response Team, with the goal of the school returning to safe in-person instruction as soon as possible.</strike>

    <h3>
      The Operational COVID 19 Response Team meeting is initiated multiple ways:
    </h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>Two or more clusters are identified by building Admin/School Nurse.  In this situation, building principal will be contact health service supervisor and/or Regional Director to schedule a meeting.  Health services supervisor will also contact building principal directly should a ‘red’ level of concern be identified on the data dashboard Items 2-7.</li>
      <li>Building Principal can initiate a meeting based on concerns and current information by contacting their region director (i.e., Principal/Admin Team are concerned about the number of unfilled subs and are not able to operate school safely).</li>
      <li>Those in the operational COVID-19 response meeting are the principal (including asst. principals if applicable), Health Services Supervisor, Chief Communication Officer, the specific region director, and the nurse. If further decisions are made regarding a possible transition to remote learning, an additional meeting will be conducted that includes additional members of the executive team.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      What happens in the operational COVID-19 response meeting?
    </h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>
        The meeting is a collaborative investigation of recent positive tests, exposures, and close contacts.  The team is looking for commonality and trends to identify numbers of staff/students who need to be quarantined.  These numbers may precipitate further steps including placing students/staff in isolation, communication with staff/parents, or 'transitioning a classroom/department/school to remote learning. The discussions and decisions are individualized, but a collaborative meeting response is common.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before the meeting concludes, a communication plan is established with the District communication team. This plan will inform students, staff, and parents/guardians of any revisions or additions to the Building Health and Safety Plan.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      What can a principal do ahead of time to be prepared?
    </h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>
        According to the principals who have gone through this process through an operational COVID-19 response meeting, it is helpful if the principal can have lists of students/staff with common associations. This may include:
      </li>
      <ul class='list-styled'>
        <li>Bus routes, numbers, and rider names</li>
        <li>Athletic and co-curricular teams and club rosters and practice plans</li>
        <li>PowerSchool reports by common address to identify siblings in the same household</li>
        <li>CTE rosters and traveling students</li>
        <li>Associated quarantines and isolations (the school nurse has this info and will bring to the meeting)</li>
        <li>Staff lists, PLCs, and departments</li>
        <li>Substitute and staff absence reports</li>
        <li>Seating charts (classroom, cafeteria, specials, intervention, etc.)</li>
        <li>Student lists in special needs classrooms</li>
        <li>Small groups/intervention lists</li>
        <li>Music/choir/band involvement</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      About how long should the whole process take?
    </h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>
        The timeline for the process to complete will vary based on level of severity and complexity of the investigation. The level of severity also determines the amount of time it takes to schedule the initial meeting. Typically, meetings are scheduled less than one school day from the time of request. The meeting itself can range from 20 mins to 60 minutes.  Follow up meetings are typically shorter.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      What happens if the principal is alerted to a situation or has concerns on the weekend or a holiday break?
    </h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>
        These situations will happen outside of school operational hours, and the region director and health services supervisor are available. Please call the region director and the team will begin the investigation process pending a weekend phone/Teams meeting or next school day.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      As a parent/guardian, may I request additional mitigating measures / operational procedures for my child at school?
    </h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>
        Yes, a parent/guardian may request additional mitigating measures they would like to have in place for their individual child(ren).  An example would be a parent requiring their child to wear a mask in the classroom, even though masks are recommended to be worn but not required for all students.  To initiate these additional measures the parent/guardian must first contact school administration to schedule a meeting. A meeting will be conducted with administration and the parent/guardian in order to complete an COVID 19 Parent-Initiated Individual Student Support Plan. This purpose of this plan is to communicate the parent/guardian requests with school administration, health services, and classroom teachers.  School administration will make every effort to meet parent/guardian requests, however, given the individual needs and resources within the building to monitor the plan, final approval for each requested mitigating measure lies with building administration.

      Covid-19 Response Team Process
    </h3>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>
        The Covid-19 Response Team will review Morbidity and Mortality Rates on a daily basis.  Any appreciable changes in the danger of any variant to students or vaccinated staff will prompt an immediate implementation of mitigation responses.
      </li>
      <li>
        The response team will consider other measures (ISAT, SEL, Satisfaction) on an as-needed basis, and will review mitigation responses accordingly, but Morbidity and Mortality rates will be prioritized.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any student or staff member who is sick, either indicated symptomatically or through a positive test for any communicable disease (including Covid-19) will be required to remain home for the duration of the illness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any unvaccinated student/staff in close contact with an individual who indicated symptomatically or through a positive test for any communicable disease (including Covid-19) must:
        <ul class='list-styled'>
          <li>
            Remain home for 10 days
          </li>
          <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
          <li>
            Show a negative test for the communicable disease.
          </li>
          <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
          <li>
            Have worn a N-95 or KN-95 properly and consistently during the entire period of close contact.
          </li>
          <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
          <li>
            Attend school or extracurricular activities wearing a N-95 or KN-95 mask properly when unable to maintain a minimum six-foot distance from others, inside or out.  If the student is of insufficient maturity to guarantee proper mask-protocol, that student will be expected to remain home for the ten day period.
          </li>
          <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
          <li>
            Participate in sports without masks when on the field of play, <strong>provided that</strong> he/she was wearing a N-95 or KN-95 mask properly for the entirety of close-contact.  When off the field of play, an N-95 or KN-95 mask will be worn as soon as possible.  Those who were not wearing a N-95 or KN-95 properly for the extent of close-contact will not be allowed to participate in sports until the 10 day period is over.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Masks are strongly recommended, but are not required unless mitigation measures are implemented.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Virtual Schoolhouse will be maintained for those uncomfortable with this operational plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Parent Volunteers are considered staff for the purposes of this plan.
      </li>
    </ul>
