    <p>
      I was in the middle of drafting an update to welcome our new members when I learned that one of our own, Rocky Mountain teacher Mike McCrady, is currently fighting for his life in the ICU with Covid-19.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family has called for prayers for Mike, and we hope you can take a moment and focus your attention to the McCrady family in their hour of need. Their faith is strong, but anything you can do will surely help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that, if you’re able to provide financial assistance, you can Venmo <a href='https://venmo.com/angie-mccrady'>@Angie-McCrady</a> directly. If prompted, the four-digit confirmation code is 7203.
    </p>
    <p>
      For updates, search for the McCrady family on <a href='https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/'>Caring Bridge</a>. And if you have problems or can help in other ways, contact Ashley Locke at 208.695.4328.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we will welcome our new members. Yes, we will have updates. But for now, it’s all about Mike and his family. Please keep him closely in your thoughts and prayers.
    </p>
