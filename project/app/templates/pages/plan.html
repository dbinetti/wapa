    <h2>
      The Parents Plan for Educational Safety
    </h2>
    <p class='lead'>
        This plan is based on the following core principle:  student education should not be sacrificed to improve vaccination rates among adults who have free will.  Public Health concerns are vitally important, but our schools have neither the expertise nor the resources to serve as proxy public health officers.  The job of our schools is to educate full-time, in-person, without encumberances, and as long as the danger remains exceedingly low that should be their top priority.

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Revisions to individual school building health and safety plans will be based upon an in-depth review of Hospitalization and Mortality rates for 1) students and 2) vaccinated staff.  The in-depth review is conducted by the Operational COVID 19 Response Team.
        </p>
        <p>
          This team is a partnership between the West Ada Executive Team, school administrators, parent representatives, staff representatives, mental health services, and CDH. The team determines the appropriate response based on the metrics indicated below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revisions or additions to mitigating measures may include but are not limited to masks, distancing/podding in the classroom, increased sanitizing protocols, changes in schedules to limit class size, or shifts to remote instruction as needed to protect student and staff safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is explicitly recognized that managing community spread is a public health concern best managed by public health officials; the West Ada School District is responsible for managing a safe educational environment for students and staff.
        </p>

          Process
        </h3>
        <ul class='list-styled'>
          <li>
            The Covid-19 Response Team will review Hospitalization and Mortality Rates on a daily basis.  Any appreciable changes in the danger of any variant to students or vaccinated staff will prompt an immediate implementation of mitigation responses.
          </li>
          <li>
            The response team will consider other measures (ISAT, SEL, Satisfaction) on an as-needed basis, and will review mitigation responses accordingly, but Hospitalization and Mortality rates will be prioritized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any student or staff member who is sick, either indicated symptomatically or through a positive test for any communicable disease (including Covid-19) will be required to remain home for the duration of the illness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any unvaccinated student/staff in close contact with an individual who indicated symptomatically or through a positive test for any communicable disease (including Covid-19) must quarantine at home for 10 calendar days or may be released under the following conditions:
            <ul class='list-styled'>
              <li>
                Show a negative test for the communicable disease <strong>OR</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Attend indoor school or extracurricular activities wearing a mask properly when unable to maintain a minimum six-foot distance from others.  <strong>OR</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Participate in sports indoors or out without masks when on the field of play.  For indoor sports, when off the field of play a mask will be worn when the athlete has recovered from extertion.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Masks are strongly recommended, but are never required.  If a communicable disease is dangerous to students or vaccinated staff, masks will not be relied on for protection; remote-learning is the proper response to dangerous conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Virtual Schoolhouse will be maintained for those uncomfortable with this operational plan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Parent Volunteers are considered staff for the purposes of this plan.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
        <p>
          * This plan specifically excludes unvaccinated staff from the core metrics.  Neither testing nor vaccination will be mandated; those individuals accept personal responsibility for the consequences of their decisions.
