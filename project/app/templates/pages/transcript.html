  <strong><span class='text-warning'>Chair Amy Johnson:</span></strong> With that, we'll move on to item D, the superintendent's update. Just so I don't set Dr. Bub up, we did ask. There's a lot of discussion around school operations as we move into getting closer to August 26, which is our first day of school. Do we have any modified this year? No. So everybody is on August 26. I asked Dr. Bub to start in a superintendent update to update us on what that school operations looks like, kind of where we're at today and start to create contexts around the information that we're all seeing in the data that we're looking at. Just to keep us all on the same page and with all the same set of facts and information as we move forward. With that, I turn it over to Dr. Bub.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-primary'>Superintendent Derek Bub:</span></strong> Madam chair, trustees. Really the idea of the superintendent update came long before our COVID numbers started to rise and we started to see this stuff. We're going to take advantage of this opportunity to talk a little bit about COVID. It obviously has been the hot topic for all of us. This last week I've had the opportunity to speak with hundreds of parents on both sides of the fence. I'm going to tell you, one of the things that I love is I've been able to have conversations and we've been able to agree. We've been able to disagree. We've been able to walk away and say, we know we all have best interest for kids. I want to thank the board for all of their work. Their emails I'm sure have been blown up. My email has blown up. I get paid a little bit more than what they get paid, so I appreciate you guys. It really has been a huge support.
  </p>

  <p>
  Being able to work through this has been great with all of us. I'm going to start with a quick overview of the data. We can argue data all day. I received some data from primary health. I have some data from Central District Health. I want to acknowledge Primary Health because they have done something that I think is really important for us. They've really narrowed down some of those age brackets so we can look at non-vaccinated non-opportunity for vaccine versus opportunity for vaccine. I think that's important. As I read some of this, and some of this might be the first time for the board to hear so I want to make sure everybody hears at the same time. Ages five through 11, during that two-week period of 7/4 through 7/17, we had six positive cases with a 4.4 positivity rate. Ages five through 11, 7/18 through 7/31, that jumped to a 12.2 positivity rate with 30 positive cases.
  </p>

  <p>
  That same age group, 7/25 through 8/7 jumped to a 13.8% positivity rate with 49 cases. Ages 12 to 18 who have access to the vaccine, parent choice on whether they get vaccinated, but they have access to it.  13 positives during that 7/4 to 7/17 time period with 8.7% positivity. 43 cases that following week between 7/18 and 7/31. That's a 16.5% positivity rate. Then 70 positives during this last two week period, which was 7/25 through 8/7, which is a 21.8% positivity rate. This could represent up to 400 quarantines within our schools. I think the other thing that we consider or that I like to consider as we look through this is severity. The severity, we're really looking at Central District Health. I apologize, these numbers are a week old. But in speaking with Dr. Peterman today, he felt like these are pretty accurate numbers.
  </p>

  <p>
  Central District Health reports 55,191 cases, 1,600 of those were hospitalizations, that's of all ages. That's 2.8%. Of those 1,600, this is for the history of the pandemic since we started. Of those 1,600 hospitalizations, 24 were minors. That sits at about 1.5% of 2.8%. If you look at the total number, that is at 0.04% of cases. That means for our kids as it sits today, according to CDH health guidelines or their information, we have a 99.96% that our kids will not go into the hospital.  We are looking at data from Florida and Texas, where we've seen some rise in cases, and we've seen some additional hospitalizations. We're looking very closely at that. The other piece that I think is really important is looking at how many of our minors are being hospitalized in our mental health institutions.
  </p>

  <p>
  As we look at their social emotional health, that's really important to us. I need to make this clear to everybody, our number one goal, I think we agree as a board that our number one goal and our district administration agrees. Number one priority is for our students to be in school five days a week. We support our parents' right to choose the protections that they want. When these two items conflict though, we need support.  These two items may conflict. If we're quarantining kids at an outstanding number, we need to really look at that. That doesn't make sense to be able to quarantine kids. We want to be able to look at that. I will tell you this. I really want to look at the student perspective and look at this from a student perspective. I believe in the whole student and educating the whole student. I think we as a board believe in the whole student, educating the whole student. That is physical health and mental health.
  </p>

  <p>
  I will tell you publicly, I've been affected by both. I have lost people that I dearly love to COVID. I have lost people that I dearly loved due to mental health. I have been through both sides. I care deeply about both sides. In our community, we're battling this same issue. We are battling physical health versus economic health. We're seeing that maybe sometimes economic health is prevailing where we're keeping things open and we're allowing things to continue. I will speak, this is really from my heart. I just came out of the building. I know the impact that this has on some of our kids on both sides. I'm asking all of us, anybody that's listening, whether it be online or in-person, to respect everybody's opportunity to choose and we're going to love each other. We're going to work with the kids regardless of whether they wear a mask or not.
  </p>

  <p>
  I don't want kids to look at other kids and say, "Hey, I'm going to wear a mask," and somehow that cast judgment. Those are our kids. That is not where we want to go with this. The recommendations that have been set forth by CDH and CDC allow for us to look at community transmission. We look at community. We are a large school district. I had the opportunity to drive across the school district from one side to the other looking at property today with Mr. Yochum and Mr. Gillen. I had a glimpse of how large our school district is. One of the things that we learned from this is just because it happens in one school doesn't mean it happens in 57 schools. We can get really good at addressing our schools on a piece by piece basis and being able to put parameters in place. That may mean that a classroom needs to have masks. That may mean that a school has to have masks based on spread that we're seeing in a school. That is a piece that we need to have access to be able to do.
  </p>

  <p>
  At this time, we highly recommend our kids to have mask. We encourage our kids to have mask. Our families need to review the data with their kids and make a decision based on their comfort level. This may change. This is where we stand today. It may change. We may have to change course. I will tell you, I've heard all types of things about classrooms and distancing. I want to give some information about distancing. I was able to speak with three superintendents in three different states today regarding this exact same issue. In those states, they reported to me, K through five, they had class sizes of 32, 33 and 35. Current class sizes as of yesterday when I asked Mr. Roberts to run the numbers, we are sitting kindergarten at approximately 20 students per class. First grade, second grade and third grade at approximately 22 students per class. Fourth grade and fifth grade at 26 students per class. That's substantially lower than what we're seeing in other states.
  </p>

  <p>
  When I hear people say, well, CDC guidelines, they also allow for our community to be able to look at where we are at at our schools. We have intentionally tried to keep the numbers down in our class to allow for some distancing, which is another mitigating measure. Our Virtual School House. I'm going to start by celebrating Dr. Ray Berry. I've heard all types of things about Virtual School House, whether it worked, didn't work. I'm going to tell you. Just came out, our reading data, our IRI data placed us third overall in the state amongst all virtual schools. That's a huge accomplishment. Congratulations, Dr. Ray Berry and those students. Our Virtual School House is really built for the two extremities. When I say the two extremities, if we sit and we think to ourselves as a family, I never want my kid to wear a mask. I never want my kid to see that again.
  </p>

  <p>
  Virtual School House might be a great option. If we sit and we say, as a family, "I want my kid to be in a mask at all times." Virtual School House might be a great option. If we sit and we say, hey, we can work.  We understand that we're going to try to stay. We prefer to stay out of masks, but we understand there might be situations in which we would call for that, I would appreciate that flexibility. That's what I'm asking for tonight. Through my conversations with parents, I have realized that there may be this idea that we may need this third model. I want to walk through what that third model might look like. We will be sending out communication tomorrow. As I've met with some of these parents, I have heard things like, "Hey, I would love to put my kid in Virtual School House, but I have a second grader. My husband and I both work and I can't leave my second grader at home."
  </p>

  <p>
  I'm going to respect that idea. We're going to look at this third model, and we're going to send out a survey tomorrow. Because I don't know what those numbers look like. We're going to send out a survey tomorrow that asks parents that if you're interested in this third model, which really would provide via Virtual School House platform in a mask mandated classroom, where somebody is there to supervise kids. You want to drop your kid off. It probably will not be at their home school. If you're interested in that, that is a third option for some of our parents. We're giving as many options as we can possibly give. Additionally, Friday, our principals are being asked to send out information or another survey. You're going to get surveyed to death. I apologize. Another survey to our parents asking if they would like extra accommodations or extra mitigating measures for their child.
  </p>

  <p>
  Some of those things could be, they could ask our teachers in K through six, "Hey, can you help out? I would prefer my kid wear a mask. Can you make sure he's wearing a mask?" We can help out with that. We can pod students with masks. We can pods students independently in a classroom. During class transitions, we can hold students back and give them alternate transition times if that's a concern. We can give designated eating locations. This is where it gets to my heart. I'm just going to tell you. This is my concern. We're asking for parent choice. We're giving parent choice. If a parent chooses that, let's allow them to have that choice too. Everybody needs to have their choice. If we give everybody that choice, we will get through this together arm in arm. That's my last statement. I ask that we come together on this and not be divisive.
  </p>

  <p>
  If people want to choose one way or the other, let's allow them to choose. If parents say, "Hey, I'm really concerned, but I want my kid to be in-person," and they're going to be in a mask, let's allow them to be in a mask. If they say, "We want my kid to be podded with other kids that are in masks in a separate area in the classroom," let's allow those kids to do that.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-warning'>Unidentified Speaker:</span></strong>What if they don't want to be?
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-primary'>Superintendent Derek Bub:</span></strong> Let me make it clear. If they want to be.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-warning'>Unidentified Speaker:</span></strong>What if they don't want to be?
  What if they don't.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-primary'>Superintendent Derek Bub:</span></strong>At this time, we are recommending mask. We are not requiring mask. If they want, if parents are asking for masks, we are going to try to accommodate that as much as possible for those parents and those children.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-warning'>Chair Amy Johnson:</span></strong> I apologize. For this portion of the board, it's just the superintendent's update. I know there's a lot of questions, please. I will tell you, Dr. Bub talks to me probably every night and he's told me about the number of parents he's called and it's in over the hundreds. Frankly, we've got 40,000 students and a hundred thousand parents. He can't answer all of them. But I think if we start to send in some, and we see some commonalities, we'll try and answer every question and look at every scenario. I think that's what he's saying. I appreciate your respect. I appreciate your time and listening. I also really appreciate the fact that Dr. Bub, we're having a conversation, right? That's a good thing.
  </p>

  <p>
  We're talking about it now. We're looking at the data and we're all getting aligned on where we're going to go. We still have three weeks till school starts. Cross our fingers everything goes in the right direction. We ask for all the support in that as well. The board is not even asking questions of him. I want to make sure that's clear. It's just a statement and update. That's what the superintendent update is for. With that, I want to make sure you got to finish.
  </p>


  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-primary'>Superintendent Derek Bub:</span></strong>I would just close with, I ask that we could all be together on this. I ask that everybody can join together. I think if you really look at this, parents are getting a great choice in this. At this time, we're trying to provide options for everybody. If we can work together on this as Idahoans, and we can say, "Hey, we're going to get through this." The last thing I want to do is see our kids go through another year, tumultuous year, the way we have in the past. We want to make this a smooth year. We want our kids to learn ultimately, and we want our kids in school five days a week.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong><span class='text-warning'>Chair Amy Johnson:</span></strong> Thank you.
