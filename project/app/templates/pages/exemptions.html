    <p class='lead'>
      Medical exemptions follow a three-step process:
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class='my-5 col-lg-8'>
    <h4>
      Step One: Secure your Medical Exemption
    </h4>
    <p>
      You must receive documentation from a "medical provider" that grants an exemption which clearly indicates the name and date of birth of your child; no further explanation is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The medical provider does NOT need to be a medical doctor.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical provider definition is outlined in <a href='https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title39/t39ch77/sect39-7702/'>Title 39 of the Idaho Statute</a>, and includes the following health care professionals listed in <a href='https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title54/'>Title 54</a>:
    </p>
    <ul class='list-styled'>
      <li>Psychologists</li>
      <li>Nurses</li>
      <li>Speech Pathologists</li>
      <li>Audiologists</li>
      <li>Respiratory Therapists</li>
      <li>Dentists</li>
      <li>Orthodontists</li>
      <li>Chiropractors</li>
      <li>Optometrists</li>
      <li>Pharmacists</li>
      <li>Physical Therapists</li>
      <li>Acupuncturists</li>
      <li>Nutritionists</li>
      <li>Massage Therapists</li>
      <li>Athletic Trainers</li>
      <li>Midwifes</li>
      <li>Physicians</li>
      <li>Physician Assistants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Again, the medical provider need not be a pediatrician or MD.</strong>  They need only fall into one of above categories and be currently licensed by the State of Idaho.  Medical exemptions have already been accepted from chiropractors, nurses, and child psychologists among others.
    </p>
    <p>
      When contacting the provider, be clear that you're seeking a mask exemption letter.  You may be required to have an in-person examination and pay for the visit.  Let the provider know that <a href='https://www.cdhd.idaho.gov/dac-coronavirus-order#collapse-4'>CDH guidelines</a> indicate that an exemption can be granted on either "medical or mental health" needs, but no formal explanation is required in the document itself and they need not justify their evaluation with anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have already secured an exemption, please let us know at <a href='mailto:exemption@westadaparents.com'>exemption@westadaparents.com</a>.  We're building a list that we can share with others, and success stories are always great social proof!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an <a href='{% static "app/redacted_exemption.pdf" %}'>example exemption</a> that was successfully filed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also provide this <a href='{% static "app/exemption_form_word.docx" %}'>Word Document</a> to the medical provider as a base template.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, you can simply "fill in the blanks" of this <a href='{% static "app/exemption_form_blank.pdf" %}'>PDF Document</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Step Two: File your Exemption with the School Nurse
    </h4>
    <p>
      Your exemption can be filed via email with the School Nurse to take immediate effect.  Simply send the nurse an email with your exemption attached, and that's that.  Here is the list of current school nurses and their contact information.  Remember, we are focusing our attention on Monday, November 1st to provide solidarity with other exempted students.

    <h4>
      Step Three: Send your Child to School Mask-Free with a Courtesy Notice
    </h4>
    <p>
      This step is purely optional, but will assist your child in navigating the school environment itself and will support our teachers; they deserve the courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Elementary School it's a good idea to simply send an email to the teacher in advance indicating that you have a Medical Exemption on file with the school nurse so they can prepare accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Middle and High School, download and print this letter which your student can show any teacher or administrator.  Again, we support our staff, and they deserve this courtesy.
