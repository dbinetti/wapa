        WASD Quarantine Release Process
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can read the full <a href='https://www.westada.org/domain/11845'>Safe Return to In-Person Instruction Plan</a> for yourself, but I’ve produced a quick flow chart of the quarantine process below which makes it easier to follow:
      </p>
      <img src='{% static "app/board_plan_8_24.png" %}' class='img-fluid my-3'>
      <p>
        Basically, the left side of the flow chart is geared towards those who are vaccinated, follow the mandate, or can provide proof of a prior recovery. The right side is for students who opt-out. And while the process is complicated, the bottom line is: if you follow the mandate, you stay in school. Opt-out of the mandate, and you stay home for ten days and skip sports when exposed &mdash; and everyone will be exposed eventually, many times this year.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you know, the West Ada Parents Association saw this coming and proposed a <a href='{% url "plan" %}'>Parents Plan</a> to avoid this “back-door mandate”.  Still, the Board decided otherwise, and that’s why the more than 12,000 parents who filled out the opt-out form, drove the district office on short notice, waited in line, and submitted their form with identification in-person are going to be very surprised when they learn their kids are still going to miss school and sports unless they give up their Parental Choice.
      </p>
      <p class='lead my-3'>
        In short, this is a deliberate policy of segregation by the West Ada School District, and it must change immediately.  If you haven't already done so, please  <a href='{% url "login" %}'>join us</a> and support full and equal access to education for all students.
