          With deepest sadness we must share that Mike McCrady, beloved Rocky Mountain High School teacher and parent, has lost his battle with Covid-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope you can take a moment and focus your attention to the McCrady family: his wife Angie, and daughters Raegan and Kyra.  Their faith is strong, but Mike was taken too soon from them and your prayers can only help in their time of loss.
        </p>
