      Special Board Meeting Today
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Board has called a Special Meeting for tonight, Thursday November 11 at 5PM, and while we can’t be certain what will be discussed they presumably will be considering the two complaints I filed against Board Chair Amy Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say this because aside from appointing a temporary Clerk the only action item is Executive Session. Executive Sessions are “mini-meetings” of the Board where disciplinary actions can be considered in private; there are no notes taken, no minutes provided, no recordings made, and no public access allowed. Given that last meeting they went into Executive Session and came out with a plan to consider the two complaints against Amy Johnson, it’s reasonable to assume they’re going to do the same thing tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      So before that happens it's worthwhile reviewing the timeline of how we got here.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On August 22, 2021, Blue Cross of Idaho puts out a <a href='https://bcidaho.com/coronavirus/update-22-2021.08.22.html'>Covid-19 update</a> suggesting that Idaho will have trouble keeping schools open without masking and vaccination. Amy Johnson is a <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-johnson-mba-pba-a950a054/'>Director at Blue Cross of Idaho</a>, having been promoted to that position one month after being seated on the Board of Trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On August 24, 2021, Amy Johnson votes to send healthy kids home who elect to opt-out of the mask mandate and have close contact, specifically to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBWKFj4hQDA&t=17200s'>"incentivize masks and vaccinations"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On August 25, 2021, <a href='https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/education/article253788523.html'>tens of thousands of parents line up</a> at the district office to submit opt-out forms.
    </p>
    <img class='img-fluid my-3 img-thumbnail' src='{% static "app/parents_line.png" %}'>
    <p>
      - On August 30, children who signed opt-out forms start being sent home for ten days due to contact tracing. Thousands of healthy students eventually fall under this quarantine policy and are sent home for ten days, many without any instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On September 8th, <a href='https://www.westada.org/cms/lib/ID01904074/Centricity/Domain/79/Board%20Agendas/2021/09_27_21/min%20080821.pdf'>all opt-outs are rescinded and a mask mandate is reinstated</a> for all West Ada students, staff, and visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On Friday October 8th, <a href='https://mailchi.mp/d305e491c6b5/back-on-board'>Superintendent Bub requests</a> that the Board address Covid policy moving forward, calling for a Special Board Meeting on October 13th.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 10th, the West Ada Parents Association files a <a href='https://www.westadaparents.com/static/app/Trustee_Johnson_Complaint.pdf'>formal complaint with Vice-Chair Rene Ozuna</a>against Amy Johnson for violation of West Ada School District’s <a href='https://www.westada.org/cms/lib/ID01904074/Centricity/Domain/3644/P201_4.pdf'>Conflict of Interest Policy 201.4</a>, and calls for Amy Johnson's immediate recusal pending a full, fair and transparent investigation. Rene Ozuna acknowledges reciept of the complaint but takes no action.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On Monday, October 11th, the West Ada Parents Association holds a rally at the District Office to <a href='https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/education/article254933092.html'>call for Amy Johnson's recusal</a> until her conflict of interest investigation is complete. That day, Amy Johnson <a href='https://www.idahoednews.org/west-ada/ag-west-ada-chair-target-of-recall-effort-doesnt-have-conflict-of-interest-under-state-law/'>leaks to the press</a> an Attorney General <a href='https://www.westadaparents.com/static/app/deputy_ag_brian_kane_letter.pdf'>letter</a> solicited by Amy White, the District's legal counsel. Amy Johnson <a href='https://www.idahoednews.org/west-ada/ag-west-ada-chair-target-of-recall-effort-doesnt-have-conflict-of-interest-under-state-law/'>states to the press</a> that because of this letter, there is no conflict of interest. Amy Johnson does all this without the Board's knowledge or approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On Tuesday October 12th, Trustees cite the Attorney General’s letter in rebuffing calls for Amy Johnson’s recusal. Trustee Klopfenstein specifically states, "It's my understanding that the Attorney General of Idaho has ruled that he doesn't see a conflict of interest... With that ruling, this concern is not an issue for me."
    </p>
    <img class='img-fluid my-3 img-thumbnail' src='{% static "app/trustee_klopfenstein_response.jpg" %}'>
    <p>
      - On Wednesday, October 13th, Rene Ozuna, the Trustee to whom the complaint was directed, stays silent and allows Amy Johnson to respond to the investigation into herself. Amy Johnson begins the Special Board Meeting by <a href='https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/cbZIXIR0NiACpFtRupwwoee7gb1f4qCbhF7NZlYSoqCZ_X2RVDWGKAlJ--I6r_0t_-FbcIr9G53jAq3GEu-otMLyY38?loadFrom=SharedLink'>announcing that she will not recuse herself</a>, stating that "an independent third-party says I have no legal obligation to (do so)." Subsequent research reveals the person who provided this clearance was Amy White, the District's legal counsel who faciliated the leaked Attorney General letter. Amy White is <a href='https://www.westada.org/Page/2#calendar1/20211025/event/786253'>present at this meeting and on the agenda</a>, but is never called by Amy Johnson to present as planned. No one is aware at this meeting that Amy White is the person who cleared Amy Johnson's participation. Amy Johnson proceeds to participate in the meeting and votes to implement a mask mandate with no end date.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 14th, the West Ada Parents Association contacts Rene Ozuna for clarification on the recusal. Rene Ozuna acknowledges receipt of the email, but states she can not comment until the investigation is complete. Subsequent invesitgation reveals that Amy White has directed Board Trustees not to respond to inquiries from the West Ada Parents Association.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 15th, the West Ada Parents Association reaches out to Amy White for clarification. No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 17th, the West Ada Parents Association files a <a href='https://www.westadaparents.com/static/app/Trustee_Johnson_Complaint_10_17_21.pdf'>second complaint against Amy Johnson</a>, this time with Trustee Rusty Coffelt. This complaint focuses on Amy Johnson's deliberate deception in concealing Amy White's participation in clearing Amy Johnson's participation in the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 18th, Rusty Coffelt ackowledges receipt of the complaint, with no further elaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 21st, the West Ada Parents Association files a <a href='https://www.westadaparents.com/static/app/greivance_amy_white.pdf'>grievance with the Idaho State Bar against Amy White</a>, under Rule 1.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 22nd, hundreds of West Ada parents send messages to Rusty Coffelt to demand accountability for Amy Johnson’s deception at the October 13th Board meeting. No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 25th, the West Ada Parents Association requests a status update from Rusty Coffelt. No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On October 25th, the Board meets and enters Executive Session, whose proceedings are kept secret per Idaho Law. Amy Johnson ostensibly participates in the session, although this can’t be known for certain since again there are no notes, minutes, or recordings allowed. Following Exectutive Session, the Board votes for Rusty Coffelt and Rene Ozuna to work with district adminstration to provide a response to both complaints from the West Ada Parents Association into Amy Johnson. It is unclear if the original investigation by Amy White was completed, or ever conducted at all. It is further worth noting that the Administration reports directly to Amy Johnson as Chair of the Board, which hires all staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On November 1, the West Ada Parents Association again asks for a status update from Rusty Coffelt on the investigation, who responds that the Board will respond when everything is decided. No details of when, where, who, what or how this decision will be made are provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      - On November 10th, the West Ada School District announces a Special Board Meeting for the following Day, November 11th, at 5:00PM. The <a href='https://www.westadaparents.com/static/app/original_agenda_10_november_2021.png'>originally posted agenda</a> contains no details as to what will be discussed at the meeting. Following inquiries from the West Ada Parents Association, it is learned that the Board will enter Executive Session at the Special Board Meeting. The agenda is <a href='https://www.westada.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=2&DomainID=4#calendar1/20211111/event/791399'>subsequently updated</a> to reflect the Executive Session.
    </p>
      <hr>
    <p>
      That is the entire timeline leading up to today's Special Board Meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do want to add one final thing: since the Attorney General’s office featured so prominently in all of Amy Johnson’s efforts to avoid accountability, I reached out to Brian Kane (the Deputy Attorney General who wrote the original letter) for clarification on all this. Here was <a href='{% static "app/attorney_general_response.pdf" %}'>his response</a>:
    </p>
    <code class='my-3'>
      <p>
        The Office of the Attorney General regularly assists local government attorneys with legal analysis upon their request. Upon the request of the West Ada School District attorney [Amy White, at Amy Johnson's direction], this office provided a legal analysis of Idaho law. As you know, we analyzed only Idaho law and how Idaho’s conflict of interest statutes apply to board member Johnson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your question focuses on the office’s qualifications to analyze a local board policy. However, it’s worth reiterating that our analysis examined the matter through the lens of Idaho law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, an opinion from this office should not be construed as a “ruling” or something similar. To do so would suggest our office holds a final decision-making authority on such a matter. It does not. Our letter is simply our legal opinion of the situation when analyzed against Idaho law.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this information is helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brian [Kane]<br>
        Chief Deputy Attorney General
      </p>
    </code>
    <p>
      Let’s just say the Attorney General was not particularly pleased to have been used as part of Amy's  political manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, all of this — starting way back in August — was done in service of promoting an epidemiological agenda when a School Board’s <a href='https://www.westada.org/cms/lib/ID01904074/Centricity/Domain/3644/P201_1.pdf'>first and greatest concern</a> should be the education of our students.  <a href='https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/election/article255481311.html'>Voters noticed</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Board is serious about taking steps to restore the Public Trust in the West Ada School District they will take action against Amy Johnson to remove her from the Chair and call for her resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ll see what they decide.
